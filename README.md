# [Kaggle] Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk

## Purpose of Project 
The goal of this competition is to use various factors to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease. 
We have constructed multiple predictive models using different machine learning techniques, including LightGBM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, RandomForest, and Random Search. We aim to compare the results of each experiment to identify which model achieves the highest score.
